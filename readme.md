# Sorted Tasks

## https://asseternity.github.io/todo/

Project done in vanilla JS with Webpack.

A To-Do List app named Sorted Task where you can create projects; create, edit, complete/uncomplete tasks, collapse projects and their tasks.

This app also uses (1) Web Storage API to retain your data; (2) date-fns library to calculate days until your task's deadline.
